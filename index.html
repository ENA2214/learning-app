        <p>I have been learning html and css. I realy hope that with time, i will learn
            to be realy good at it. My goal is to be exccellent at building high
        quality websites </p><hr>
        <h2>What i need to learn html</h2>
        <p>
          A few things that i will need are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a laptop</li>
          <li>constant electricity</li>
          <li>a smartphone</li>
          <li>data/ access to the internet</li>
          <li>video courses on html and css</li>
          <li>a lot of time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>  Benefits of learning html and css include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>we can mack money from it <b>obviously</b></li>
          <li>it can be used to get a job</li>
          <li>it can be used to build high quality websites</li>
          <li>it can be used to build web aplications</li>
          <li>it can be used to style websites as well</li>
          <li>it is a solid skill to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But css and html are not all that i need to learn. most importantly i need
          to learn <i><b>JAVASCRIPT.</b></i>, Yes i know that it is a daunting task
          , one that needs the utmost dedication but i am prety confident in my ability
          and capasity to learn. So i need ti begin to study as hard as i can. 
          I alrwady puting in a lot of effort into learning html, so i am a little
          confident that i can face JAVASCRIPT head on.
        </p>
        <p>Why did i choose to take this career path? well it really as to do with peer
           preasure. But i am grateful for that preasure for helping me to be head
           today. thank you very much.

          My endgame
        </h2>
        <p><!--INDENT OTHER THINGS-->
          So what exactly do i want to achieve by taking this path. well, first we need 
          some backstory. I once promised myself that i would never ever involve myself
          in anything <abbr title=" INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY">I.T.</abbr>  related. why? you might ask, well i thought that i did not want to be one of those <abbr title=" INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY">I.T.</abbr>  bros. But one day i saw how much <strong>money</strong> was involved in this and i said to myself" you know what, maybe its not such a bad idea". The real reason was because i was not informed about how brod and diverse the <abbr title=" INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY">I.T.</abbr>  feild really is. The moment i saw how big it was i was entirely convinced. So, now, i dream of beecoming a software engineer. can i acomplish this task. Well honestly i do not have a choice. I must succede, i must win, i must learn. wish me the best as i embark on this journey.
